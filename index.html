              Comet integrates with all of your favorite 
              tools, so you can run your corner of the
              world exactly how you like it. It translates
              your tool's changes into changes in the
              tools the rest of your team is using. Finally,
              the developers can't force you to open GitHub
              ever again.

              Using an artificial intelligence, Comet
              can learn how your team works, and automatically
              find places to grease the wheels. Have a team member
              that is always forgetting to mark their tasks as "done"? 
              What about someone who never includes screenshots?
              Never again.
